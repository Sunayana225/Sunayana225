Hi, I'm Sunayana ðŸ‘‹

Full-stack developer â€” I build AI-integrated web apps, reliable backends, and automation that solve real problems.

## **Tech Snapshot**
**Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML, Tailwind  
**Backend / APIs:** Node.js, Flask, Custom REST APIs, Firebase / Firestore  
**AI & Automation:** RAG (vector search + embeddings), prompt engineering, n8n workflows, lightweight retrieval-based bots  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, Netlify, Streamlit, VS Code

## **Selected Projects**
**PetPal** â€“ Pet food safety checker  
REST API (Node.js + Firestore) with RAG retrieval for food safety queries

**Discord RAG Bot** â€“ Context-aware chat assistant  
Vector embeddings + retrieval from a vector DB; uses fetched context to generate answers. Built for real-chat use inside Discord.

**TaskFlow** â€“ Real-time collaborative task manager  
React + Firebase. Live chat, notifications, and n8n automations to push updates/workflow steps.

**WeatherGuard** â€“ Emergency alerts & workflows  
Aggregates weather alerts, triggers automated safety workflows (n8n), and notifies users in real time.

**EstateHub** â€“ Property search & messaging  
Listings platform with real-time messaging (Firebase) and data-driven UI for searching/filtering properties.

## **Research & Algorithms**
**Tabu Search (TSP)** â€” Experimental project: modified Tabu Search to improve route optimization and explorationâ€“exploitation balance. (Research/algorithm focus â€” see repo for benchmarks.)

## **Currently learning**
ML fundamentals with PyTorch & scikit-learn â€” building intuition for model training and evaluation (so I can move beyond calling models to understanding and fine-tuning them).

## **Open to**
